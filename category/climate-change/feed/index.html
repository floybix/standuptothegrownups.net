<p><strong>And this is what she wrote back:</strong></p>



<p>Dear Prime Minister,<br></p>



<p>Thank you for writing back to me about climate change, but some of the things you said in your letter are not true. I did some research and my mum helped me to understand.<br></p>



<p>For example, you said: ‘Australia is working very hard with other countries to fix this problem.’<br></p>



<p>But you didn’t even go to the last international climate change conference in Madrid in December 2019. You sent your energy minister Angus Taylor, who argued that Australia should be allowed to meet its targets by using credits from an old climate agreement. When you went to the Pacific Islands Forum, you stopped the Forum from making promises to cut emissions because you didn&#8217;t want to phase out coal-fired power. The Tongan Prime Minister actually cried. I don&#8217;t think that sounds like you are working with <strong>other countries </strong>to fix the problem, it actually sounds like you are stopping other countries from fixing climate change.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>You said : ‘Our promise to reduce emissions is large.’<br></p>



<p>But Australia’s emissions target under the Paris Agreement on climate change is only to reduce emissions to 26 percent below 2005 levels by 2030, and you said you want to meet it by using credits from an old agreement, the Kyoto Protocol. The British Prime Minister said they would have net zero emissions by 2050.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>You said : ‘Our Climate Solutions Package will make sure we meet our promises. It will help reduce emissions, improve energy use in homes and business, and get us ready for electric vehicles.’<br></p>



<p>But the National Greenhouse Gas Inventory shows that emissions went down a lot between 2009 and 2014 and then have been about the same since, which is when you’ve been in government. This shows that the Climate Solutions Package is not reducing emissions. Also, when the Labor Party said it wanted more electric vehicles at the last election, you said they wanted to end the weekend.<br></p>



<p>You said: ‘We are leading the world in renewable energy.’<br></p>



<p>But your government reduced the Renewable Energy Target and keeps talking about wanting to get more energy from coal and gas. During the super duper really really bad bushfires, you said more action on climate change was ‘reckless’. You just signed an agreement with New South Wales to increase gas production, even though methane is a really bad greenhouse gas. When the South Australian government built the world’s biggest battery to store energy from its solar and wind plants, you said it was like the Big Banana, even though the energy regulator says it has made the electricity system cheaper and more reliable. So I don’t think you’re really encouraging renewable energy.<br></p>



<p>You said: ‘I strongly encourage you to learn more about science, technology, engineering and maths because it’s through research, innovation and enterprise that we will be able to make a real contribution to our environment.’<br></p>



<p>But hundreds of scientists have written to you asking you to reduce emissions more, so why would you listen to me? Also lots of firemen wrote to you last year asking you to talk to them about preparing for bushfires because scientists predicted they would be bad this year, and you didn’t.<br></p>



<p>So I am still really angry about your climate policies.<br></p>



<p>Yours sincerely,&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yassine </p>

<p>My sister and I have been collecting signatures at our schools on this petition to ask the Australian Prime Minister to put a price on carbon, because this is the most efficient and effective way of bringing down emissions.</p>



<p>I would love any other Australian kids to collect signatures at their schools or with their friends, so here is the text. You can print it out at your school. When you get signatures, it would be great if you could scan the signed pages and send them to <a href="mailto:hi@standuptothegrownups.net">hi@standuptothegrownups.net </a>and I will tell you when we collect enough to present them to the Prime Minister. We have a bit more than 200 signatures now. We are doing printed ones to prove that they are signed by actual kids. It is hard to do that with online petitions. It also shows that they all care enough to actually sign a piece of paper rather than just pressing a button on a device.</p>



<p>To: The Hon Scott Morrison MP, Prime Minister of Australia</p>



<p>We, the undersigned, are the children of Australia. We are deeply alarmed by the dangers that climate change is posing for our future. This summer, hundreds of children lost their homes and some children lost their parents to catastrophic bushfires all over Australia. Over <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-50951043">11 million hectares of land </a>was destroyed and around a billion animals died. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jan/03/canberra-chokes-on-worlds-worst-air-quality-as-city-all-but-shut-down">Canberra </a>and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jan/15/australians-need-a-slip-slop-slap-style-campaign-to-learn-about-air-pollution">Melbourne </a>both recorded the worst air quality in the world on some days and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/dec/10/sydneys-air-11-times-worse-than-hazardous-levels-as-australias-bushfires-rage">Sydney </a>had choking and hazardous smoke for weeks. <a href="https://www.environment.gov.au/climate-change/adaptation/publications/fire-regimes">Scientists and bushfire experts </a>say this is because climate change has made the land hotter and drier. <a href="https://www.climatecouncil.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/fire-chiefs-statement-pages.pdf">Fire chiefs </a>say fires are harder to fight because the fire seasons are longer and overlap with those in other countries so we can&#8217;t share their resources. Economists say the most effective and cheapest way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is by putting a <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/programs/pricing-carbon">price on carbon</a>. Australia&#8217;s <a href="https://www.environment.gov.au/system/files/resources/8d47dec2-cd70-4a67-a7ab-85d67f3d53be/files/nggi-quarterly-update-jun-2019.pdf">National Greenhouse Gas Inventory </a>shows that our emissions went down when we had a price on carbon and stopped going down when the Abbott government removed it.</p>



<p>We call on you to re-introduce a compulsory price on carbon in Australia.<br></p>

<p><strong>This is a letter my younger sister wrote to Prime Minister Scott Morrison about his climate change policies. We have posted his reply <a href="https://standuptothegrownups.net/163/prime-minister-reply/">here</a>. </strong></p>



<p>Dear Prime Minister<br></p>



<p>I am really angry with your policies that are not doing enough to stop climate change. In fact, supporting coal just makes climate change worse.<br></p>



<p>I am going to miss Grandfriends Day at my school, which is only once a year and really fun, and the only chance for my old neighbours to come and see what I am doing at school. This is because I am going to the school strike for climate action on Friday 20 September, which is the same day as Grandfriends Day. I am really sad to miss Grandfriends Day but I am doing it because I care about my future and other people’s futures.<br></p>



<p>I am only nine years old and kids my age are giving up special occasions like grandfriends day to make you change your policies by protesting because it is so important to us. I really hope that you will listen to us. I also think that you should go to the UN climate summit.<br></p>



<p>Yours sincerely,</p>



<p>Yassine</p>

<p><strong>This is the letter I sent to my principal explaining why I was going to miss school for the School Strike for Climate Action on 15 March 2019. After I sent this my principal said that she supported me going, however since we were a public school we couldn’t promote it at all. I also went to the September 2019 school strike, but then the ACT Labor government said it would support it, so public schools were able to promote it.</strong></p>



<p>Dear (principal),<br></p>



<p>&nbsp;On the 15th of March, I won’t be attending school, I will be at the school strike for climate action. The school strike is where a group of students skip school to call on the government to take more effective action against climate change.<br></p>



<p>&nbsp;Climate impacts are growing a lot. We’ve had bushfires in winter, and NSW and QLD had been gripped by a crippling drought. Yet our government wants to help billionaire coal companies, like Adani, build massive new coal mines. Coal-fired power plants continue to make climate change worse.<br></p>



<p>&nbsp;I think climate change is a really pressing matter, especially now, when we can still make a difference. I honestly think the government is being quite selfish. It’s my generation which will be inheriting this world, and if we don’t do something soon, it will be too late!<br></p>



<p>&nbsp;I hope you will understand that I do care about my education, and I promise to catch up on any work I miss, but I think it’s worth missing one day of school to make this statement. I’m sorry I’ll miss Anti-bullying day, but this school strike is a global event on the 15th of March, and I feel it’s really important to the world.<br></p>



<p>Yours sincerely,<br></p>



<p>Zari<br></p>
