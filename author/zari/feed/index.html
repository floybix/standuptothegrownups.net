<p><strong>And this is what she wrote back:</strong></p>



<p>Dear Prime Minister,<br></p>



<p>Thank you for writing back to me about climate change, but some of the things you said in your letter are not true. I did some research and my mum helped me to understand.<br></p>



<p>For example, you said: ‘Australia is working very hard with other countries to fix this problem.’<br></p>



<p>But you didn’t even go to the last international climate change conference in Madrid in December 2019. You sent your energy minister Angus Taylor, who argued that Australia should be allowed to meet its targets by using credits from an old climate agreement. When you went to the Pacific Islands Forum, you stopped the Forum from making promises to cut emissions because you didn&#8217;t want to phase out coal-fired power. The Tongan Prime Minister actually cried. I don&#8217;t think that sounds like you are working with <strong>other countries </strong>to fix the problem, it actually sounds like you are stopping other countries from fixing climate change.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>You said : ‘Our promise to reduce emissions is large.’<br></p>



<p>But Australia’s emissions target under the Paris Agreement on climate change is only to reduce emissions to 26 percent below 2005 levels by 2030, and you said you want to meet it by using credits from an old agreement, the Kyoto Protocol. The British Prime Minister said they would have net zero emissions by 2050.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>You said : ‘Our Climate Solutions Package will make sure we meet our promises. It will help reduce emissions, improve energy use in homes and business, and get us ready for electric vehicles.’<br></p>



<p>But the National Greenhouse Gas Inventory shows that emissions went down a lot between 2009 and 2014 and then have been about the same since, which is when you’ve been in government. This shows that the Climate Solutions Package is not reducing emissions. Also, when the Labor Party said it wanted more electric vehicles at the last election, you said they wanted to end the weekend.<br></p>



<p>You said: ‘We are leading the world in renewable energy.’<br></p>



<p>But your government reduced the Renewable Energy Target and keeps talking about wanting to get more energy from coal and gas. During the super duper really really bad bushfires, you said more action on climate change was ‘reckless’. You just signed an agreement with New South Wales to increase gas production, even though methane is a really bad greenhouse gas. When the South Australian government built the world’s biggest battery to store energy from its solar and wind plants, you said it was like the Big Banana, even though the energy regulator says it has made the electricity system cheaper and more reliable. So I don’t think you’re really encouraging renewable energy.<br></p>



<p>You said: ‘I strongly encourage you to learn more about science, technology, engineering and maths because it’s through research, innovation and enterprise that we will be able to make a real contribution to our environment.’<br></p>



<p>But hundreds of scientists have written to you asking you to reduce emissions more, so why would you listen to me? Also lots of firemen wrote to you last year asking you to talk to them about preparing for bushfires because scientists predicted they would be bad this year, and you didn’t.<br></p>



<p>So I am still really angry about your climate policies.<br></p>



<p>Yours sincerely,&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yassine </p>

<p><strong>Why should you write a letter to a food company?</strong></p>



<ul><li>If you are unhappy with the way a food company is dealing with things like single use plastics, a good thing you can do is write a letter to them</li></ul>



<p><strong>How can you structure the letter?</strong></p>



<ul><li>You can do this many ways depending on which food company it is, and whether it is a very big company or a small one, but there are some good rules to go by when writing letters</li><li>You can see these rules <a href="https://standuptothegrownups.net/11/tips-page/">here</a></li></ul>



<p><strong>What are the main points to include in the letter?</strong></p>



<ul><li>Important points might be things like what you want them to do, what your solution is, and why you want them to do it.</li><li>It&#8217;s also worth saying that you will recommend against using their product until they change. If they get enough letters like this, they might see a commercial benefit in changing.</li><li>You can also see <a href="https://standuptothegrownups.net/147/basic-activism-principals/">Basic Activism Principles</a> for more</li></ul>



<p><strong>How can you find the contact details for the company?</strong></p>



<ul><li>Most companies have websites, but they often only have contact forms for customer service</li><li>Companies generally want people to know about them, but they don&#8217;t want people to contact them, expecially if they are going to complain about their packaging</li><li>For a lot of companies, you need to find out who the actual owner is, for example in the letter below we found out that Just Juice was owned by Suntory</li><li>Then we searched &#8216;Suntory&#8217; and &#8216;chief executive Australia&#8217; and found some old news articles</li><li>We then searched the name in the articles to see if he was still the chief executive, and he was</li><li>Then we found the company&#8217;s office address from their website and sent the letter to him directly</li></ul>



<p><strong>To Just Juice on plastic packaging and plastic straws</strong></p>



<p>Dear Mr Fullerton,</p>



<p>We are the G-Force from (primary school). We are trying to eliminate plastic waste from our school. Our school canteen sells your 200ml Just Juice boxes. We like to use your boxes, but we have realised that your plastic straws and plastic straw wrappers can’t be recycled. Also, every piece of plastic ever made is still in the environment today and this is causing a massive waste problem. </p>



<p>We’ve seen cardboard straws being used at cafes and we wonder if you can put them in your juice boxes with paper wrapping rather than plastic. That way the boxes, straws and wrappers can all be recycled together. Also paper can be recycled until it turns into compost, whereas plastic stays in the environment forever. </p>



<p>We are recommending to the canteen to discontinue using Just Juice until you have stopped using plastic. </p>



<p>Yours sincerely</p>



<p>Yassine, on behalf of G-Force<br>11 September 2020</p>



<p><strong>To Mrs Mac&#8217;s Pies on plastic wrapping</strong></p>



<p>Dear Mr Slaughter,</p>



<p>We&nbsp; are from the Aranda Primary School G-Force and we are trying to reduce plastic waste from our canteen. Our canteen sells your pies and sausage rolls. On your website, you said you were sustainable and your food waste gets turned into energy. But meanwhile, you are individually wrapping each of your products in single-use plastic. Every piece of plastic ever made is still in the environment today and this is causing a massive waste problem.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You could wrap your products in paper or cardboard which can be composted and can help gardens. We are recommending that the canteen stop using Mrs Mac’s Pies until you have stopped using plastic.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yours sincerely,&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yassine, on behalf of G-Force<br>11 September 2020</p>



<p><strong>To Bulla on plastic lids for frozen yoghurt </strong></p>



<p>Dear Mr Hood,</p>



<p>We are from the Aranda Primary School G-Force. We are trying to eliminate plastic waste from our school canteen. They sell your frozen yoghurt. We all like to have them but we don’t like that they are covered in plastic. Every piece of plastic ever made is still in the environment today and this is causing a massive waste problem. If you would like to help us reach our goal of eliminating plastic from our school, you could use cardboard lids, cardboard containers and wooden paddles.</p>



<p>We are recommending that the canteen stop using your frozen yoghurt until you have stopped using plastic.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yours sincerely,</p>



<p>Yassine, on behalf of G-Force<br>11 September 2020</p>



<p><strong>Here is the response we got from Bulla</strong></p>



<p>Dear Yassine &nbsp;</p>



<p>Thank you so much for your letter. It is nice to hear from you and I am so glad that you took the time to write to me personally.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bulla is an Australian family-owned business for over 110 years, and we care very passionately about the environment so it can be shared with future generations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You will be pleased to hear that Bulla is in the process of converting the Frozen Yogurt packaging from plastic to paperboard. This change is due to take place by the end this year. It does however take over twelve months to make a change such as this. That is a long time I know, but there are so many things to do. First, we need to source appropriate packaging that is suitable for our equipment. Secondly, w<em>e </em>need to trial the packaging on our factory equipment so that it runs smoothly, Finally, we must ensure that our amazing product has the same quality and taste in the new packaging materials.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We have been working on this for some time and hope to have the change finalized by the end of the year. So, I do hope you, and your friends, will be patient with us and continue to buy our products to enjoy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At Bulla we ensure that all our packaging is recyclable. To achieve this, all packaging is assessed using the Planet Ark Packaging Recyclability Evaluation Portal (PREP) tool.</p>



<p>We are moving awa<em>y </em>from plastic where possible and introducing paperboard packaging. We have a range of delicious Ice Cream products that use paper packaging, such as our Bulla Splits, Bulla Icy Pops and Bulla Crunch Sticks and the paper packaging is 100% recyclable on all of these. Recently, we launched a yummy range of Ice Cream Tubs &#8220;Murray Street&#8221; all packed in paperboard tubs, which are 100% recyclable and made from renewable material.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thank you again for your letter and for caring so much about our environment. I hope you are happy with the approach we have taken here at Bulla.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Kind regards <br>Allan&nbsp;<br>Allan Hood | Chief Executive Officer<br>February 2021</p>

<p>If you hear someone saying mean and biased things, a good way to deal with it is to call it out with some good questions on the spot. </p>



<p>But sometimes doing this leads to people saying untrue things about you. </p>



<p>So what do you do with this?</p>



<p>1. <strong>Don&#8217;t get sucked into negativity.</strong><br>Telling yourself your life is ruined will only make you more stressed. Acknowledge natural guilty feelings. Even if you are innocent, you may will experience feelings of guilt. When someone points a finger at you, some parts of you may feel that you must have done something wrong to deserve such negative treatment. This is totally normal but also irrational.</p>



<p>2. <strong>Find support in others</strong><br>Your friends and family know you better than anyone else and will trust in  you. They will share their positive feelings about you with others. If you have a trusted grownup &#8211; like a parent, friend, teacher or employer &#8211; then talk to them about it. The best way to protect your mental health and self-esteem is to get support. (You can still Stand Up to your Grownup later, but supportive grownups are good when you have to Stand Up to Nasty People).</p>



<p>3. <strong>Don&#8217;t buy into the hate</strong><br>Your friends will probably want to pile in to defend you. It&#8217;s not worth it. </p>



<p><span style="color:#1a56bd" class="has-inline-color"><strong><em>Do not interact on social media. It is so easy to say mean things on social media.</em></strong> &#8211; <em>Vivienne Gstrein</em></span></p>



<p>4. <strong>If you can&#8217;t ignore it, remember your legal rights</strong><br>Most countries have laws against defamation, which means publishing untrue things about someone to damage their reputation. Under Australian laws, defamation includes any form of public speech or publication, including social media. In some states and territories, maliciously defaming someone is a crime. </p>



<p>You could use this:</p>



<p><span style="color:#1a56bd" class="has-inline-color"><em>Publishing false material to harm someone&#8217;s reputation is illegal under the Defamation Act 2001. Malicious publication of defamatory information is a criminal offence with a maximum penalty of 3 years imprisonment. You have 14 days to remove this post and post the following apology: &#8220;I apologise unreservedly for posting fake screenshots attributing racist and anti-semitic comments to Zari. She has never made such comments. I will never fake defamatory statements about anyone again.&#8221; If you do not remove your post and post this apology by (two weeks from the date of the post), further legal action will be taken.</em></span></p>



<p>If it doesn&#8217;t work, then public schools recommend that you go to the police.</p>

<p>I had this conversation on the Prime Minister&#8217;s instagram account after he told people not to go to the Black Lives Matter protests in June 2020. It is very long but I have included it in full with some comments on each person&#8217;s arguments.</p>



<p>In summary, though, I said this country was founded on genocide, which is a very strong and emotive word, for which I was rightly challenged. In my responses, I included specific references to the <a href="https://treaties.un.org/doc/publication/unts/volume%2078/volume-78-i-1021-english.pdf">UN Convention for the Prevention and Punishment of Genocide</a>. A friend of mine, who joined the conversation to defend me, used specific historical references to the First Fleet. The main person arguing against us based their argument on their own credentials as someone who claims to have a PhD in Australian history and is married to a Wiradjuri woman. They then make a series of assertions about other peoples who suffered violence. But they don&#8217;t provide any specific evidence to support their claims.</p>



<p>So using strong emotive words is more likely to generate a response, but make sure before you do it that you can defend your claims with facts, and that you have credible sources.</p>



<p>As you can see in this conversation, I was trying to be calm and constructive, open to other opinions, and not rude. The other person in this conversation is also being calm, which is good and means that the conversation can be constructive. </p>

<p>My sister and I have been collecting signatures at our schools on this petition to ask the Australian Prime Minister to put a price on carbon, because this is the most efficient and effective way of bringing down emissions.</p>



<p>I would love any other Australian kids to collect signatures at their schools or with their friends, so here is the text. You can print it out at your school. When you get signatures, it would be great if you could scan the signed pages and send them to <a href="mailto:hi@standuptothegrownups.net">hi@standuptothegrownups.net </a>and I will tell you when we collect enough to present them to the Prime Minister. We have a bit more than 200 signatures now. We are doing printed ones to prove that they are signed by actual kids. It is hard to do that with online petitions. It also shows that they all care enough to actually sign a piece of paper rather than just pressing a button on a device.</p>



<p>To: The Hon Scott Morrison MP, Prime Minister of Australia</p>



<p>We, the undersigned, are the children of Australia. We are deeply alarmed by the dangers that climate change is posing for our future. This summer, hundreds of children lost their homes and some children lost their parents to catastrophic bushfires all over Australia. Over <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-50951043">11 million hectares of land </a>was destroyed and around a billion animals died. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jan/03/canberra-chokes-on-worlds-worst-air-quality-as-city-all-but-shut-down">Canberra </a>and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jan/15/australians-need-a-slip-slop-slap-style-campaign-to-learn-about-air-pollution">Melbourne </a>both recorded the worst air quality in the world on some days and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/dec/10/sydneys-air-11-times-worse-than-hazardous-levels-as-australias-bushfires-rage">Sydney </a>had choking and hazardous smoke for weeks. <a href="https://www.environment.gov.au/climate-change/adaptation/publications/fire-regimes">Scientists and bushfire experts </a>say this is because climate change has made the land hotter and drier. <a href="https://www.climatecouncil.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/fire-chiefs-statement-pages.pdf">Fire chiefs </a>say fires are harder to fight because the fire seasons are longer and overlap with those in other countries so we can&#8217;t share their resources. Economists say the most effective and cheapest way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is by putting a <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/programs/pricing-carbon">price on carbon</a>. Australia&#8217;s <a href="https://www.environment.gov.au/system/files/resources/8d47dec2-cd70-4a67-a7ab-85d67f3d53be/files/nggi-quarterly-update-jun-2019.pdf">National Greenhouse Gas Inventory </a>shows that our emissions went down when we had a price on carbon and stopped going down when the Abbott government removed it.</p>



<p>We call on you to re-introduce a compulsory price on carbon in Australia.<br></p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table class=""><tbody><tr><td>Name</td><td>Age</td><td>Address / school</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>After the first page, you only need:</p>



<p>We call on you to re-introduce a compulsory price on carbon in Australia.<br></p>

<p><strong>Here are some basic principles for activists in pursuing their causes.</strong></p>



<p><strong>1) Know what you want and why you want it.</strong><br>When you are deciding whether to protest against something, or join a cause, think hard about what you want to achieve and why.</p>



<p>For example, when I wanted to join the School Strike for Climate Action in 2019, my parents made me find out what the strike organisers were asking for and said I could only go if I agreed with what they wanted and if I <a href="http://standuptothegrownups.net/16/school-strike-letter/">wrote to my school principal</a> and explained to her why I was going. This meant that I had to understand what I was striking for. This is important because you will not help your cause if someone asks you why you are there and you can&#8217;t explain it.</p>



<p>Similarly, when I was angry about <a href="http://standuptothegrownups.net/19/maths-test-petition/">a maths test in Year 8</a>, it wasn&#8217;t just because I did badly in it, it was because I felt the reason I did badly was not because I didn&#8217;t understand or I didn&#8217;t study hard enough, but because of the disruption in the way the test was administered, especially getting half the questions halfway through the test.</p>



<p><strong>2) Try to have constructive proposals as well as knowing the things you don&#8217;t want (the things you are protesting against).</strong><br>Sometimes you just need to tell people in power to stop doing something, but it often helps if you also have some suggestions about what you want them to do. People in power want to know what they would need to do to stop you from protesting. This doesn&#8217;t mean that they will do it, but they are more likely to be receptive if you have a list of demands rather than just complaints.</p>



<p>For example, when Yassine was asking her <a href="http://standuptothegrownups.net/25/reducing-plastic-waste-in-the-canteen/">school canteen</a> to phase out single use plastics, she actually did some research into what items they might be able to replace, and how they might replace them.</p>



<p><strong>3) Think about why they might want to do what you want.</strong><br>People are more likely to change their behaviour and do what you want if you can make them see why it is reasonable, or better still, why it is in their interest to do it.</p>



<p>For example, when I wrote to my <a href="http://standuptothegrownups.net/13/homework-in-hong-kong/">school principals in Hong Kong</a> asking them to make homework optional, I pointed out to them that students were likely to learn more if they got enough sleep and had time to play with their siblings. Since the school was really keen to get good results from their students, this argument showed that their objective would be achieved with less homework.</p>



<p><strong>4) Always be polite and respectful, even if the people you are opposing or petitioning are not.</strong><br>People who don&#8217;t like what you are saying will take any excuse not to listen to you, and if your behaviour is aggressive or offensive then they will ignore what you are asking for and focus on why nobody should listen to such an aggressive or offensive person. If you make your arguments respectfully, then they have to focus on the substance of what you are saying. </p>



<p>So, even if you think your opponent is stupid or biased, you should present your arguments as if they were really clever and objective. It won&#8217;t necessarily work but at least they can&#8217;t then say that <em>you </em>are stupid and biased.</p>



<p>For example, when Yassine was told that the canteen couldn&#8217;t have wooden forks because kids might break them and use them as weapons, she thought that was quite a silly argument. But instead of saying so, she did <a href="https://standuptothegrownups.net/161/wooden-forks/">a series of experiments with actual wooden forks</a> to see how easy they were for kids to break and whether they would be sharp enough to be dangerous.</p>



<p><strong>5) Remember that activism is its own reward.</strong><br>If you work really hard on an issue and something changes, the powerful people who made it change may take the credit. This is very annoying, but it is better not to tell everyone that actually you made them change their minds and that they made concessions and backed down. This is because it will make it much harder to get them to change anything in the future if you do this, because nobody (especially a powerful person) likes people to think they are weak. It is better to remind yourself (repeatedly if necessary) that what you wanted has actually happened and that you have helped to make the world a better place, even if you didn&#8217;t get recognition for it. The people who are close to you will know and, most importantly, you will know.</p>

<p><strong>These are some practical tips to help with things like letter writing and handling the media.</strong></p>



<p>How to write a good letter:</p>



<ul><li>Get to the point</li><li>Say at the beginning what you want them to do</li><li>Explain why you want them to do it</li><li>Use some examples to show what you have said</li><li>Analyse what you have said</li><li>&nbsp;Summarize everything you have said and restate your point</li><li>Do it formally (no or little slang)</li><li>Check your facts with good research&nbsp;</li><li>Read over your letter and make sure your spelling and grammar is correct</li><li>Use simple words and write clearly</li><li>Don’t use swear words</li></ul>



<p></p>



<p>How to organise a petition, campaign or protest:</p>



<ul><li>Advertise!<ul><li>If you want to spread the word about your campaign, you have to advertise</li><li>Put up posters around town</li><li>Advertise on social media platforms</li><li>Email, text, contact everyone you know</li></ul></li><li>Contact the politicians<ul><li>Let them know what you are doing</li><li>If you can, try and get some politicians to come along and speak at the event</li></ul></li><li>Work really, really hard<ul><li>Organizing an event like this is really hard, so you have to make sure that it&#8217;s really what you want to do </li></ul></li><li>Know exactly what you want<ul><li>If you are going to organize a huge event like this, you have to have the reasons you are unhappy and a solution to the problem or some demands</li><li>Make sure the solution/demands are reasonable and realistic</li></ul></li><li>Don’t do propaganda (e.g don’t say “Repeat after me!”)&nbsp;<ul><li>Lots of organizers like to have speakers come up and tell people what to say, but contrary to popular belief, this really annoying, and gives off the vibe that you are trying to tell them what to think. Instead have speakers present evidence that what the government/whoever is responsible for the problem is wrong. </li><li>It is okay to organise chants just while marching, but not in between speeches.</li></ul></li></ul>



<p></p>



<p>Handling the Media:</p>



<ul><li>Don’t be scared<ul><li>Journalists/reporters are usually really nice people so there is no reason to be scared</li><li>They have probably dealt with people a lot more nervous than you, so know how to help</li><li>Even if you stuff up really bad you can always retake the shot</li></ul></li><li>It’s not your job to fill up the space&nbsp;<ul><li>Don&#8217;t get sucked into trying to fill up the space</li><li>If you do it can be dangerous because it can make you say things that you don&#8217;t want to say</li></ul></li><li>Don’t be scared to correct yourself<ul><li>It&#8217;s always better to just say &#8216;sorry I meant this&#8217; rather than ignore it and keep speaking, especially if what you said was factually incorrect.</li></ul></li><li>Stay calm. It doesn’t look like you know what you’re doing otherwise.<ul><li>If you are looking really nervous on camera, then you could come off as trying to hide something&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li>Don’t use palm cards too much, and don’t show them to the camera too much.<ul><li>Otherwise it may look like someone else wrote everything you have to say!</li><li>A way to avoid this is by practicing your interview beforehand (you could even ask your parents to ask you questions an interviewer might ask) </li></ul></li><li>Always check your claims!<ul><li>This is probably the most important tip</li><li>This is really important because as long as you have checked all your claims and everything you say is factually correct, you have credibility.</li><li>Credibility is really important if you want people to believe what you are saying</li></ul></li><li>Don’t criticize the person, it’s better to criticize the policy/action<ul><li>This is something many politicians need to learn</li><li>As I said before in &#8216;Activism in Schools&#8217; you have to be respectful</li><li>This not only makes you more credible, but it makes sure that you aren&#8217;t just criticizing, you are finding a solution</li></ul></li><li>Stay on track<ul><li>Make sure you don&#8217;t start talking about one thing and then another and then another</li></ul></li><li>Don’t avoid questions (It makes you look like you’re trying to hide something)<ul><li>It’s okay if you don’t have all the answers, especially if you’re only a child </li><li>If you can&#8217;t answer a question because you don&#8217;t know the answer, it&#8217;s okay to say that you don&#8217;t know</li></ul></li></ul>

<h4>Definition of&nbsp;<em>civil disobedience</em></h4>



<p><strong>: </strong>refusal to obey governmental demands or commands especially as a nonviolent and usually collective means of forcing concessions from the government<br>(<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/civil%20disobedience" target="_blank">https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/civil%20disobedience</a>)<br>An accompanying feature is usually also submitting to the legal consequences. Many protestors who have engaged in civil disobedience have used their court appearances as an opportunity to state their case for protest.<br></p>



<p>Some prominent people who have engaged in civil disobedience:<br><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Emmeline-Pankhurst" target="_blank">Emmeline Pankhurst </a>(1858-1928), a British activist who campaigned for women to have the right to vote (called &#8216;suffrage&#8217;). She and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/zy2ycdm/revision/4" target="_blank">her Women&#8217;s Social and Political Movement broke the law </a>by disrupting parliament, chaining themselves to railings and burning churches. Many were imprisoned and went on hunger strike.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.history.com/topics/india/mahatma-gandhi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mohandas (Mahatma) Gandhi&nbsp;</a>(1869-1948), an Indian activist who campaigned for India&#8217;s independence from Britain. At the time, Indians were prohibited from collecting or selling salt (which everyone needed), so Gandhi organised a small group of followers to collect salt from seawater. This action was called the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.history.com/topics/india/salt-march" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Salt March</a>. More and more people joined across the coastal cities. Gandhi was arrested but by then he had thousands of followers in his campaign of&nbsp;<em>satyagraha</em>, or civil disobedience. Gandhi was killed by a Hindu nationalist in 1948, after India gained independence.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.history.com/topics/black-history/rosa-parks" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rosa Parks&nbsp;</a>(1913-2005), is known as the mother of the American civil rights movement because she refused to give up her seat on a bus for a white man, as then required under Alabama state law. She was arrested (but only fined) but her action sparked the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/rosa-parks-ignites-bus-boycot" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Montgomery bus boycott</a>, which eventually led to the US Supreme Court striking down the Alabama state and Montgomery city laws that required blacks and whites to travel separately on buses.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.nelsonmandela.org/content/page/biography" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rolihlahla (Nelson) Mandela&nbsp;</a>(1918-2013) was an activist involved in both non-violent and violent resistance to the apartheid regime in South Africa.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/apartheid" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apartheid&nbsp;</a>(a Dutch-Afrikaans word meaning &#8216;separateness&#8217;) laws made black, white and &#8216;coloured&#8217; South Africans live, travel, go to school and shop in separate places. While they were supposed to be &#8216;separate but equal&#8217;, the minority white population had access to good education, jobs and property, while the others, particularly the majority black population, did not. Mandela was sentenced to life imprisonment in 1964 and spent the next 26 years in prison. During his trial, instead of testifying, he made a three hour &#8216;<a href="http://db.nelsonmandela.org/speeches/pub_view.asp?pg=item&amp;ItemID=NMS010&amp;txtstr=prepared%20to%20die" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Speech from the Dock</a>&#8216;, where he declared he was prepared to die for democratic ideals. After apartheid was dismantled in 1990-91, Mandela was elected President of South Africa in the first multi-racial election in 1994.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.history.com/topics/black-history/martin-luther-king-jr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Martin Luther King Jr&nbsp;</a>(1929-1968) organised the Montgomery bus boycott, and also played a leading role in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.history.com/topics/black-history/martin-luther-king-jr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Birmingham campaign&nbsp;</a>(Birmingham and Montgomery are towns in the US state of Alabama, which was one of the states that had slavery before the US Civil War in the 1860s). As a result he was arrested and imprisoned, where he wrote his famous&nbsp;<a href="https://www.africa.upenn.edu/Articles_Gen/Letter_Birmingham.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Letter from Birmingham Jail</a>, which laid out his case for equal rights for black Americans, and criticised those arguing for a more moderate approach to civil rights. During the March on Washington in 1963, when 250,000 people marched in the US capital to protest against inequality suffered by black Americans, King made his famous &#8216;<a href="https://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/mlkihaveadream.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I have a dream</a>&#8216; speech. He was killed in 1968 by a white racist. The 3rd Monday in January is now a national holiday in the US, called &#8216;Martin Luther King Day&#8217;.</p>

<p><strong>My little sister, Yassine, wrote a proposal to her school canteen committee about reducing plastic waste in the canteen. They didn&#8217;t do much in 2019 when she wrote, but they have now agreed to work on it with the Year 5 and 6 environment team. Since she&#8217;s on that team, she is hoping to get more action in 2020.</strong></p>



<p>This proposal is to reduce plastic waste from the canteen.<br></p>



<p>For lunches that are made in the canteen and sold in portions, we could have reusable containers instead of single use plastic.<br></p>



<p>Either kids could bring their own containers from home to school, or the canteen could sell standard reusable containers.<br></p>



<p>If kids bring their own containers from home, the canteen staff could just put in a standard measure (eg. a standard ladle) of food, no matter what size the container.<br></p>



<p>Kids bringing reusable containers would have to bring their clean labelled containers to the canteen when they come to school so that the canteen staff have time to fill them in the morning. Then kids would take their containers home to wash after school.<br></p>



<p>To encourage people to use reusable containers, perhaps the canteen could give them a small credit each time they use a reusable container, or the canteen could charge 20 cents or 50 cents extra to people who don’t bring their own container.</p>



<p>By Yassine<br></p>



<p><strong>These are the notes that she has taken:</strong></p>



<p>Here are the existing types of packaging and single use plastic in the canteen.<br></p>



<p>.	plastic forks</p>



<p>.	cling wrap for carrot sticks</p>



<p>.	hard plastic containers for frozen grapes</p>



<p><strong>.</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>plastic lids and waxed paper cups (non recyclable) for frozen yoghurt</strong></p>



<p><strong>.</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>soft plastic juice stick wrappers</strong></p>



<p>.	hard plastic containers for fruit salad</p>



<p><strong>.</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>Tetra paks for just juice</strong></p>



<p><strong>.</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>milk cartons</strong></p>



<p>.	plastic containers for spag bol</p>



<p>.	plastic containers for salads</p>



<p>.	hard foil packs for mac and cheese</p>



<p><strong>.</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>soft plastic for cruiser pies</strong></p>



<p><strong>.</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>soft plastic for sausage rolls</strong><br></p>



<p>The ones in bold are commercially bought so probably can’t be changed without changing the supplier and the product.<br></p>



<p>For the others, here are some suggestions.<br></p>



<ol><li>Bring your own containers for spag bol, salads, fruit salads and frozen grapes. If possible, the canteen could raise the prices of these items by 50 cents, then give a 50 cent credit back to everyone who brings their own container. Containers would have to be clearly labelled and taken to the canteen before school.&nbsp;</li></ol>



<ol><li>We could also have a container library for people who forget and after the person finishes their lunch, they have to bring the container back. We could also put out a bin for the containers but they will have to be washed.</li></ol>



<ol><li>If a container library is too hard, we could have compostable or recyclable cardboard boxes like (local cafe).</li></ol>



<ol><li>For the carrots, we could just have carrots without the cling wrap.</li></ol>



<ol><li>We could have people bring in forks instead of having plastic forks. </li></ol>



<p> If having people bringing in forks is too hard, we could have wooden forks instead of plastic ones. </p>

<p><strong>This is a letter my younger sister wrote to Prime Minister Scott Morrison about his climate change policies. We have posted his reply <a href="https://standuptothegrownups.net/163/prime-minister-reply/">here</a>. </strong></p>



<p>Dear Prime Minister<br></p>



<p>I am really angry with your policies that are not doing enough to stop climate change. In fact, supporting coal just makes climate change worse.<br></p>



<p>I am going to miss Grandfriends Day at my school, which is only once a year and really fun, and the only chance for my old neighbours to come and see what I am doing at school. This is because I am going to the school strike for climate action on Friday 20 September, which is the same day as Grandfriends Day. I am really sad to miss Grandfriends Day but I am doing it because I care about my future and other people’s futures.<br></p>



<p>I am only nine years old and kids my age are giving up special occasions like grandfriends day to make you change your policies by protesting because it is so important to us. I really hope that you will listen to us. I also think that you should go to the UN climate summit.<br></p>



<p>Yours sincerely,</p>



<p>Yassine</p>



<p></p>
