<p>Here&#8217;s what the ACT government had to say about her</p>



<p><strong>Sustainability Leadership &#8211; Primary Student: </strong>Yassine Andrews, Aranda Primary School</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.actsmart.act.gov.au/__data/assets/image/0004/1914322/Aranda-Primary-Yassine-resized.jpg" alt="Student from Aranda Primary standing in front of a tree"/></figure>



<p>Year 6 student Yassine is an ambassador for Plastic Oceans and has lobbied food suppliers, Parent and Citizens Associations, and the school canteen to reduce avoidable plastic packaging they sell and reconsider the food products they have on offer.&nbsp;&nbsp;She has even written to the Governor General and many politicians inviting them to join her on the Picnic Unwrapped program.</p>



<p>Yassine has demonstrated leadership, constant enthusiasm, initiative, and commitment to sustainability through their school’s environment group, G-Force.</p>



<p>Check out Yassine’s work here:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4MXlr4X5ww" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4MXlr4X5ww</a></p>

<p><strong>Yassine wrote this letter when she heard the Environment Minister was going to hold a National Plastics Summit and wanted kids there. She never got a response, but two kids in her class went because someone in the environment department who was working with their mum realised they hadn&#8217;t invited any kids from our state and that the mum had kids the right age.</strong> <strong>Yassine found out because they happened to be in her class.</strong> <strong>Those kids also care about plastic waste but that isn&#8217;t why they were invited. Guess the Minister wasn&#8217;t that serious about having kids who actually want to do something.</strong></p>



<p>The Hon Sussan Ley MP<br>Minister for the Environment<br>Parliament House<br>Canberra<br>ACT 2600<br></p>



<p>Dear Minister,&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>I heard that you are going to have a national summit on plastic and recycling and that you want to invite school children.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>I’m going into year 5 this year and I am reducing plastic waste from the school canteen. So I sent lots of ideas to the school canteen. I understood that we couldn’t get rid of <em>all </em>the plastic in the canteen.<br></p>



<p>I would like to come to the meeting because I would like to discuss ideas with other people so I can come back and do it at my own school.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>I have attached some of the letters I sent.<br></p>



<p>I hope you are having a great holiday.</p>



<p>Yours sincerely,<br>Yassine</p>
