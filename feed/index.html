<p>Here&#8217;s what the ACT government had to say about her</p>



<p><strong>Sustainability Leadership &#8211; Primary Student: </strong>Yassine Andrews, Aranda Primary School</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.actsmart.act.gov.au/__data/assets/image/0004/1914322/Aranda-Primary-Yassine-resized.jpg" alt="Student from Aranda Primary standing in front of a tree"/></figure>



<p>Year 6 student Yassine is an ambassador for Plastic Oceans and has lobbied food suppliers, Parent and Citizens Associations, and the school canteen to reduce avoidable plastic packaging they sell and reconsider the food products they have on offer.&nbsp;&nbsp;She has even written to the Governor General and many politicians inviting them to join her on the Picnic Unwrapped program.</p>



<p>Yassine has demonstrated leadership, constant enthusiasm, initiative, and commitment to sustainability through their school’s environment group, G-Force.</p>

<p><strong>This is what the Prime Minister wrote to Yassine:</strong></p>

<p><strong>And this is what she wrote back:</strong></p>



<p>Dear Prime Minister,<br></p>



<p>Thank you for writing back to me about climate change, but some of the things you said in your letter are not true. I did some research and my mum helped me to understand.<br></p>



<p>For example, you said: ‘Australia is working very hard with other countries to fix this problem.’<br></p>



<p>But you didn’t even go to the last international climate change conference in Madrid in December 2019. You sent your energy minister Angus Taylor, who argued that Australia should be allowed to meet its targets by using credits from an old climate agreement. When you went to the Pacific Islands Forum, you stopped the Forum from making promises to cut emissions because you didn&#8217;t want to phase out coal-fired power. The Tongan Prime Minister actually cried. I don&#8217;t think that sounds like you are working with <strong>other countries </strong>to fix the problem, it actually sounds like you are stopping other countries from fixing climate change.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>You said : ‘Our promise to reduce emissions is large.’<br></p>



<p>But Australia’s emissions target under the Paris Agreement on climate change is only to reduce emissions to 26 percent below 2005 levels by 2030, and you said you want to meet it by using credits from an old agreement, the Kyoto Protocol. The British Prime Minister said they would have net zero emissions by 2050.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>You said : ‘Our Climate Solutions Package will make sure we meet our promises. It will help reduce emissions, improve energy use in homes and business, and get us ready for electric vehicles.’<br></p>



<p>But the National Greenhouse Gas Inventory shows that emissions went down a lot between 2009 and 2014 and then have been about the same since, which is when you’ve been in government. This shows that the Climate Solutions Package is not reducing emissions. Also, when the Labor Party said it wanted more electric vehicles at the last election, you said they wanted to end the weekend.<br></p>



<p>You said: ‘We are leading the world in renewable energy.’<br></p>



<p>But your government reduced the Renewable Energy Target and keeps talking about wanting to get more energy from coal and gas. During the super duper really really bad bushfires, you said more action on climate change was ‘reckless’. You just signed an agreement with New South Wales to increase gas production, even though methane is a really bad greenhouse gas. When the South Australian government built the world’s biggest battery to store energy from its solar and wind plants, you said it was like the Big Banana, even though the energy regulator says it has made the electricity system cheaper and more reliable. So I don’t think you’re really encouraging renewable energy.<br></p>



<p>You said: ‘I strongly encourage you to learn more about science, technology, engineering and maths because it’s through research, innovation and enterprise that we will be able to make a real contribution to our environment.’<br></p>



<p>But hundreds of scientists have written to you asking you to reduce emissions more, so why would you listen to me? Also lots of firemen wrote to you last year asking you to talk to them about preparing for bushfires because scientists predicted they would be bad this year, and you didn’t.<br></p>



<p>So I am still really angry about your climate policies.<br></p>



<p>Yours sincerely,&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yassine </p>

<p><strong>Why should you write a letter to a food company?</strong></p>



<ul><li>If you are unhappy with the way a food company is dealing with things like single use plastics, a good thing you can do is write a letter to them</li></ul>



<p><strong>How can you structure the letter?</strong></p>



<ul><li>You can do this many ways depending on which food company it is, and whether it is a very big company or a small one, but there are some good rules to go by when writing letters</li><li>You can see these rules <a href="https://standuptothegrownups.net/11/tips-page/">here</a></li></ul>



<p><strong>What are the main points to include in the letter?</strong></p>



<ul><li>Important points might be things like what you want them to do, what your solution is, and why you want them to do it.</li><li>It&#8217;s also worth saying that you will recommend against using their product until they change. If they get enough letters like this, they might see a commercial benefit in changing.</li><li>You can also see <a href="https://standuptothegrownups.net/147/basic-activism-principals/">Basic Activism Principles</a> for more</li></ul>



<p><strong>How can you find the contact details for the company?</strong></p>



<ul><li>Most companies have websites, but they often only have contact forms for customer service</li><li>Companies generally want people to know about them, but they don&#8217;t want people to contact them, expecially if they are going to complain about their packaging</li><li>For a lot of companies, you need to find out who the actual owner is, for example in the letter below we found out that Just Juice was owned by Suntory</li><li>Then we searched &#8216;Suntory&#8217; and &#8216;chief executive Australia&#8217; and found some old news articles</li><li>We then searched the name in the articles to see if he was still the chief executive, and he was</li><li>Then we found the company&#8217;s office address from their website and sent the letter to him directly</li></ul>



<p><strong>To Just Juice on plastic packaging and plastic straws</strong></p>



<p>Dear Mr Fullerton,</p>



<p>We are the G-Force from (primary school). We are trying to eliminate plastic waste from our school. Our school canteen sells your 200ml Just Juice boxes. We like to use your boxes, but we have realised that your plastic straws and plastic straw wrappers can’t be recycled. Also, every piece of plastic ever made is still in the environment today and this is causing a massive waste problem. </p>



<p>We’ve seen cardboard straws being used at cafes and we wonder if you can put them in your juice boxes with paper wrapping rather than plastic. That way the boxes, straws and wrappers can all be recycled together. Also paper can be recycled until it turns into compost, whereas plastic stays in the environment forever. </p>



<p>We are recommending to the canteen to discontinue using Just Juice until you have stopped using plastic. </p>



<p>Yours sincerely</p>



<p>Yassine, on behalf of G-Force<br>11 September 2020</p>



<p><strong>To Mrs Mac&#8217;s Pies on plastic wrapping</strong></p>



<p>Dear Mr Slaughter,</p>



<p>We&nbsp; are from the Aranda Primary School G-Force and we are trying to reduce plastic waste from our canteen. Our canteen sells your pies and sausage rolls. On your website, you said you were sustainable and your food waste gets turned into energy. But meanwhile, you are individually wrapping each of your products in single-use plastic. Every piece of plastic ever made is still in the environment today and this is causing a massive waste problem.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You could wrap your products in paper or cardboard which can be composted and can help gardens. We are recommending that the canteen stop using Mrs Mac’s Pies until you have stopped using plastic.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yours sincerely,&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yassine, on behalf of G-Force<br>11 September 2020</p>



<p><strong>To Bulla on plastic lids for frozen yoghurt </strong></p>



<p>Dear Mr Hood,</p>



<p>We are from the Aranda Primary School G-Force. We are trying to eliminate plastic waste from our school canteen. They sell your frozen yoghurt. We all like to have them but we don’t like that they are covered in plastic. Every piece of plastic ever made is still in the environment today and this is causing a massive waste problem. If you would like to help us reach our goal of eliminating plastic from our school, you could use cardboard lids, cardboard containers and wooden paddles.</p>



<p>We are recommending that the canteen stop using your frozen yoghurt until you have stopped using plastic.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yours sincerely,</p>



<p>Yassine, on behalf of G-Force<br>11 September 2020</p>



<p><strong>Here is the response we got from Bulla</strong></p>



<p>Dear Yassine &nbsp;</p>



<p>Thank you so much for your letter. It is nice to hear from you and I am so glad that you took the time to write to me personally.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bulla is an Australian family-owned business for over 110 years, and we care very passionately about the environment so it can be shared with future generations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You will be pleased to hear that Bulla is in the process of converting the Frozen Yogurt packaging from plastic to paperboard. This change is due to take place by the end this year. It does however take over twelve months to make a change such as this. That is a long time I know, but there are so many things to do. First, we need to source appropriate packaging that is suitable for our equipment. Secondly, w<em>e </em>need to trial the packaging on our factory equipment so that it runs smoothly, Finally, we must ensure that our amazing product has the same quality and taste in the new packaging materials.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We have been working on this for some time and hope to have the change finalized by the end of the year. So, I do hope you, and your friends, will be patient with us and continue to buy our products to enjoy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At Bulla we ensure that all our packaging is recyclable. To achieve this, all packaging is assessed using the Planet Ark Packaging Recyclability Evaluation Portal (PREP) tool.</p>



<p>We are moving awa<em>y </em>from plastic where possible and introducing paperboard packaging. We have a range of delicious Ice Cream products that use paper packaging, such as our Bulla Splits, Bulla Icy Pops and Bulla Crunch Sticks and the paper packaging is 100% recyclable on all of these. Recently, we launched a yummy range of Ice Cream Tubs &#8220;Murray Street&#8221; all packed in paperboard tubs, which are 100% recyclable and made from renewable material.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thank you again for your letter and for caring so much about our environment. I hope you are happy with the approach we have taken here at Bulla.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Kind regards <br>Allan&nbsp;<br>Allan Hood | Chief Executive Officer<br>February 2021</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>If you hear someone saying mean and biased things, a good way to deal with it is to call it out with some good questions on the spot. </p>



<p>But sometimes doing this leads to people saying untrue things about you. </p>



<p>So what do you do with this?</p>



<p>1. <strong>Don&#8217;t get sucked into negativity.</strong><br>Telling yourself your life is ruined will only make you more stressed. Acknowledge natural guilty feelings. Even if you are innocent, you may will experience feelings of guilt. When someone points a finger at you, some parts of you may feel that you must have done something wrong to deserve such negative treatment. This is totally normal but also irrational.</p>



<p>2. <strong>Find support in others</strong><br>Your friends and family know you better than anyone else and will trust in  you. They will share their positive feelings about you with others. If you have a trusted grownup &#8211; like a parent, friend, teacher or employer &#8211; then talk to them about it. The best way to protect your mental health and self-esteem is to get support. (You can still Stand Up to your Grownup later, but supportive grownups are good when you have to Stand Up to Nasty People).</p>



<p>3. <strong>Don&#8217;t buy into the hate</strong><br>Your friends will probably want to pile in to defend you. It&#8217;s not worth it. </p>



<p><span style="color:#1a56bd" class="has-inline-color"><strong><em>Do not interact on social media. It is so easy to say mean things on social media.</em></strong> &#8211; <em>Vivienne Gstrein</em></span></p>



<p>4. <strong>If you can&#8217;t ignore it, remember your legal rights</strong><br>Most countries have laws against defamation, which means publishing untrue things about someone to damage their reputation. Under Australian laws, defamation includes any form of public speech or publication, including social media. In some states and territories, maliciously defaming someone is a crime. </p>



<p>You could use this:</p>



<p><span style="color:#1a56bd" class="has-inline-color"><em>Publishing false material to harm someone&#8217;s reputation is illegal under the Defamation Act 2001. Malicious publication of defamatory information is a criminal offence with a maximum penalty of 3 years imprisonment. You have 14 days to remove this post and post the following apology: &#8220;I apologise unreservedly for posting fake screenshots attributing racist and anti-semitic comments to Zari. She has never made such comments. I will never fake defamatory statements about anyone again.&#8221; If you do not remove your post and post this apology by (two weeks from the date of the post), further legal action will be taken.</em></span></p>



<p>If it doesn&#8217;t work, then public schools recommend that you go to the police.</p>

<p>Did you know that kids in Australia <strong>as young as 10 years old</strong> can be put in prison? That means kids in Year 4. It&#8217;s called the minimum age of criminal responsibility. In most countries, it&#8217;s 14. <a href="https://www.un.org/esa/socdev/unyin//documents/wyr11/FactSheetonYouthandJuvenileJustice.pdf">The UN</a> says it should not be younger than 12.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>The age of criminal responsibility is in the power of both the Commonwealth (federal, or national) government and individual States and Territories. At the moment, children under 10 are considered to be too young to be held responsible for crimes. From 10 years old, children can be imprisoned for crimes if a court decides they knew what they were doing was wrong. </p>



<p>But <a href="https://www.lawcouncil.asn.au/docs/7b6b5121-5220-ea11-9403-005056be13b5/AMA%20and%20LCA%20Policy%20Statement%20on%20Minimum%20Age%20of%20Criminal%20Responsibility.pdf">doctors and lawyers</a> say that children under 14 can&#8217;t be fully responsible, because even if they know they are doing something wrong, they can&#8217;t control themselves to stop doing it. </p>



<p>You can help by talking to grownups you know and letting them know that the kids in detention are not evil people, but just <strong>#KidsLikeUs</strong>. Also, you can write to the Premier or Chief Minister, and the Attorney-General in your State or Territory. You can also write to the Prime Minister and the federal Attorney-General, the Hon Christian Porter MP, because there are some federal crimes as well. Here are some <a href="https://standuptothegrownups.net/282/letters-on-raising-the-age/">letters</a> that we have written.</p>

<p>The ACT Legislative Assembly passed a motion on 20 August 2020 saying the ACT should raise the age of criminal responsibility to 14, but that it would not happen until after the ACT election in October 2020. </p>



<p><strong>Yassine wrote to the Chief Minister and the Attorney-General of the ACT to ask them to promise they would do it if they win the election and also to lobby other states and territories to do the same.</strong> <strong>The Attorney-General sent back a handwritten card promising to do it if they win the election.</strong></p>



<p>Mr. Gordon Ramsay MLA<br>Attorney-General<br>Australian Capital Territory</p>



<p>Dear Mr. Ramsay,</p>



<p>I wrote to Chief Minister Barr to ask if he could please try to raise the age of criminal responsibility to 14 or maybe even more than that because kids under 14 can’t really think ahead and stop themselves from doing dumb things.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I turned 10 this year, and when I stole my dad’s new earphones and played with them, I knew I was doing something that was wrong, but I still did it. If I had done that at the Apple Store, and someone called the police, I could have been <em>arrested</em>. I was lucky, because it was just my dad’s, so I just got a big lecture and a grumpy dad. But some kids aren’t as lucky, but they’re still just <strong>kids like me</strong>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When I heard that the State and Territory Attorneys-General decided not to raise the age last month, I was really sad. I’m happy that the ACT Assembly agreed to raise the age if you win the election this year and I hope you will persuade all the other States and Territories to do it too.</p>



<p>Yours sincerely,</p>



<p>Yassine <br>23 August 2020</p>



<p><strong>Zari wrote to the leader of the Canberra Liberals (Alistair Coe) and the Shadow Attorney-General (Jeremy Hanson), because the Liberals voted against the motion, so if they win the ACT election, they might not do it.</strong></p>



<p>Mr Jeremy Hanson CSC<br>Shadow Attorney-General<br>ACT Legislative Assembly<br>GPO Box 1020<br>Canberra ACT 2601</p>



<p>Dear Mr Hanson,</p>



<p>The ACT Assembly recently passed a motion to raise the age of criminal responsibility from 10 to 14 years. The Canberra Liberals voted against it. Close to 600 children aged 10 to 13 are locked up in Australia each year. Around two thirds of these children are Indigenous. The Royal Australian College of Physicians says that kids this age aren’t mentally developed enough to understand what they are doing, even though they know it’s wrong. The Law Council of Australia also says that criminal punishments do not work on children. Children who go through the criminal justice system are much more likely to become criminals, and much less likely to get jobs. In the long term putting kids in prison makes society less safe.&nbsp;</p>



<p>My sister is 10 years old right now and I don’t think she is capable of thinking through the consequences of something she does. If she’s angry or frustrated or even just bored, she may do something dumb and not think about the implications of what she’s doing. Probably, my sister will never end up coming into contact with the criminal justice system, because she is lucky and has a comfortable middle class life and family, with lots of attention. Rich middle class kids can also do bad things, but they will be able to afford good lawyers and support programs to keep them out of prison. The kids who do end up doing bad things are not bad kids. They are just kids like me and my sister and your kids.</p>



<p>The UN Committee on the Rights of the Child says the minimum age of criminal responsibility should be at least 14, and yet Australia is still putting 10 year olds in prison. Why are the Canberra Liberals supporting this?</p>



<p>Yours sincerely,<br>Zari<br>25 August 2020</p>

<p>I am Zari&#8217;s sister Yassine, and I am 10. I went to a web meeting with the ACT Minister for Indigenous Affairs and Senator Malarndirri McCarthy and asked what kids should do to help Reconciliation in our community. Senator McCarthy said that we should talk to Indigenous people and raise awareness. So the next day, I talked to my friend, Jenna, who is from the Yorta Yorta tribe, about whether we should ask our principal if we could invite Katrina Fanning (2020 ACT Australian of the Year and chair of the ACT Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Elected Body) to the school to talk about Reconciliation. I thought of Katrina because she was kind to me in the meeting. <br></p>



<p>We wrote to the principal, but because of COVID &#8211; 19, he wouldn&#8217;t let her do an assembly. So we asked her if we could interview her on video and she said yes! Then we got our teachers to agree that we could get all the Year 5/6 kids to write down a question. Jenna and I spent a day in the holidays turning 150 questions into about 14 questions that made sense.&nbsp;</p>



<p><br>In the end, she came to the school and we filmed it there. It was really a lot of work, but it was fun, because I did it with Jenna.&nbsp;</p>



<p><br>I hope you like it. It is a public video, so you can send it to anyone you like if you think they are interested.</p>

<p>I had this conversation on the Prime Minister&#8217;s instagram account after he told people not to go to the Black Lives Matter protests in June 2020. It is very long but I have included it in full with some comments on each person&#8217;s arguments.</p>



<p>In summary, though, I said this country was founded on genocide, which is a very strong and emotive word, for which I was rightly challenged. In my responses, I included specific references to the <a href="https://treaties.un.org/doc/publication/unts/volume%2078/volume-78-i-1021-english.pdf">UN Convention for the Prevention and Punishment of Genocide</a>. A friend of mine, who joined the conversation to defend me, used specific historical references to the First Fleet. The main person arguing against us based their argument on their own credentials as someone who claims to have a PhD in Australian history and is married to a Wiradjuri woman. They then make a series of assertions about other peoples who suffered violence. But they don&#8217;t provide any specific evidence to support their claims.</p>



<p>So using strong emotive words is more likely to generate a response, but make sure before you do it that you can defend your claims with facts, and that you have credible sources.</p>



<p>As you can see in this conversation, I was trying to be calm and constructive, open to other opinions, and not rude. The other person in this conversation is also being calm, which is good and means that the conversation can be constructive. </p>

<p><strong>Yassine wrote this letter when she heard the Environment Minister was going to hold a National Plastics Summit and wanted kids there. She never got a response, but two kids in her class went because someone in the environment department who was working with their mum realised they hadn&#8217;t invited any kids from our state and that the mum had kids the right age.</strong> <strong>Yassine found out because they happened to be in her class.</strong> <strong>Those kids also care about plastic waste but that isn&#8217;t why they were invited. Guess the Minister wasn&#8217;t that serious about having kids who actually want to do something.</strong></p>



<p>The Hon Sussan Ley MP<br>Minister for the Environment<br>Parliament House<br>Canberra<br>ACT 2600<br></p>



<p>Dear Minister,&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>I heard that you are going to have a national summit on plastic and recycling and that you want to invite school children.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>I’m going into year 5 this year and I am reducing plastic waste from the school canteen. So I sent lots of ideas to the school canteen. I understood that we couldn’t get rid of <em>all </em>the plastic in the canteen.<br></p>



<p>I would like to come to the meeting because I would like to discuss ideas with other people so I can come back and do it at my own school.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>I have attached some of the letters I sent.<br></p>



<p>I hope you are having a great holiday.</p>



<p>Yours sincerely,<br>Yassine</p>

<p>My sister and I have been collecting signatures at our schools on this petition to ask the Australian Prime Minister to put a price on carbon, because this is the most efficient and effective way of bringing down emissions.</p>



<p>I would love any other Australian kids to collect signatures at their schools or with their friends, so here is the text. You can print it out at your school. When you get signatures, it would be great if you could scan the signed pages and send them to <a href="mailto:hi@standuptothegrownups.net">hi@standuptothegrownups.net </a>and I will tell you when we collect enough to present them to the Prime Minister. We have a bit more than 200 signatures now. We are doing printed ones to prove that they are signed by actual kids. It is hard to do that with online petitions. It also shows that they all care enough to actually sign a piece of paper rather than just pressing a button on a device.</p>



<p>To: The Hon Scott Morrison MP, Prime Minister of Australia</p>



<p>We, the undersigned, are the children of Australia. We are deeply alarmed by the dangers that climate change is posing for our future. This summer, hundreds of children lost their homes and some children lost their parents to catastrophic bushfires all over Australia. Over <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-50951043">11 million hectares of land </a>was destroyed and around a billion animals died. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jan/03/canberra-chokes-on-worlds-worst-air-quality-as-city-all-but-shut-down">Canberra </a>and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jan/15/australians-need-a-slip-slop-slap-style-campaign-to-learn-about-air-pollution">Melbourne </a>both recorded the worst air quality in the world on some days and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/dec/10/sydneys-air-11-times-worse-than-hazardous-levels-as-australias-bushfires-rage">Sydney </a>had choking and hazardous smoke for weeks. <a href="https://www.environment.gov.au/climate-change/adaptation/publications/fire-regimes">Scientists and bushfire experts </a>say this is because climate change has made the land hotter and drier. <a href="https://www.climatecouncil.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/fire-chiefs-statement-pages.pdf">Fire chiefs </a>say fires are harder to fight because the fire seasons are longer and overlap with those in other countries so we can&#8217;t share their resources. Economists say the most effective and cheapest way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is by putting a <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/programs/pricing-carbon">price on carbon</a>. Australia&#8217;s <a href="https://www.environment.gov.au/system/files/resources/8d47dec2-cd70-4a67-a7ab-85d67f3d53be/files/nggi-quarterly-update-jun-2019.pdf">National Greenhouse Gas Inventory </a>shows that our emissions went down when we had a price on carbon and stopped going down when the Abbott government removed it.</p>



<p>We call on you to re-introduce a compulsory price on carbon in Australia.<br></p>
