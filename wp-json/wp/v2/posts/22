In fact, supporting coal just makes climate change worse.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am going to miss Grandfriends Day at my school, which is only once a year and really fun, and the only chance for my old neighbours to come and see what I am doing at school. This is because I am going to the school strike for climate action on Friday 20 September, which is the same day as Grandfriends Day. I am really sad to miss Grandfriends Day but I am doing it because I care about my future and other people\u2019s futures.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am only nine years old and kids my age are giving up special occasions like grandfriends day to make you change your policies by protesting because it is so important to us. I really hope that you will listen to us. I also think that you should go to the UN climate summit.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yours sincerely,<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yassine<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-link is-provider-laureates-open-letter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<a href=\"https:\/\/laureatebushfiresclimate.wordpress.com\/\">An Open Letter on Australian Bushfires and Climate: Urgent Need for Deep Cuts in Carbon&nbsp;Emissions<\/a>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>please read and share.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>This is a letter my younger sister wrote to Prime Minister Scott Morrison about his climate change policies.
