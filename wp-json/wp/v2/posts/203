I went to a web meeting with the ACT Minister for Indigenous Affairs and Senator Malarndirri McCarthy and asked what kids should do to help Reconciliation in our community. Senator McCarthy said that we should talk to Indigenous people and raise awareness. So the next day, I talked to my friend, Jenna, who is from the Yorta Yorta tribe, about whether we should ask our principal if we could invite Katrina Fanning (2020 ACT Australian of the Year and chair of the ACT Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Elected Body) to the school to talk about Reconciliation. I thought of Katrina because she was kind to me in the meeting.\u00a0<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We wrote to the principal, but because of COVID &#8211; 19, he wouldn&#8217;t let her do an assembly. So we asked her if we could interview her on video and she said yes! Then we got our teachers to agree that we could get all the Year 5\/6 kids to write down a question. Jenna and I spent a day in the holidays turning 150 questions into about 14 questions that made sense.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><br>In the end, she came to the school and we filmed it there. It was really a lot of work, but it was fun, because I did it with Jenna.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><br>I hope you like it. It is a public video, so you can send it to anyone you like if you think they are interested.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I am Zari&#8217;s sister Yassine, and I am 10.
