We are trying to eliminate plastic waste from our school. Our school canteen sells your 200ml Just Juice boxes. We like to use your boxes, but we have realised that your plastic straws and plastic straw wrappers can\u2019t be recycled. Also, every piece of plastic ever made is still in the environment today and this is causing a massive waste problem. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We\u2019ve seen cardboard straws being used at cafes and we wonder if you can put them in your juice boxes with paper wrapping rather than plastic. That way the boxes, straws and wrappers can all be recycled together. Also paper can be recycled until it turns into compost, whereas plastic stays in the environment forever. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We are recommending to the canteen to discontinue using Just Juice until you have stopped using plastic. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yours sincerely<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yassine, on behalf of G-Force<br>11 September 2020<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>To Mrs Mac&#8217;s Pies on plastic wrapping<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dear Mr Slaughter,<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&nbsp; are from the Aranda Primary School G-Force and we are trying to reduce plastic waste from our canteen. Our canteen sells your pies and sausage rolls. On your website, you said you were sustainable and your food waste gets turned into energy. But meanwhile, you are individually wrapping each of your products in single-use plastic. Every piece of plastic ever made is still in the environment today and this is causing a massive waste problem.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You could wrap your products in paper or cardboard which can be composted and can help gardens. We are recommending that the canteen stop using Mrs Mac\u2019s Pies until you have stopped using plastic.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yours sincerely,&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yassine, on behalf of G-Force<br>11 September 2020<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>To Bulla on plastic lids for frozen yoghurt <\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dear Mr Hood,<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We are from the Aranda Primary School G-Force. We are trying to eliminate plastic waste from our school canteen. They sell your frozen yoghurt. We all like to have them but we don\u2019t like that they are covered in plastic. Every piece of plastic ever made is still in the environment today and this is causing a massive waste problem. If you would like to help us reach our goal of eliminating plastic from our school, you could use cardboard lids, cardboard containers and wooden paddles.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We are recommending that the canteen stop using your frozen yoghurt until you have stopped using plastic.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yours sincerely,<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yassine, on behalf of G-Force<br>11 September 2020<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Here is the response we got from Bulla<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dear Yassine &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you so much for your letter. It is nice to hear from you and I am so glad that you took the time to write to me personally.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bulla is an Australian family-owned business for over 110 years, and we care very passionately about the environment so it can be shared with future generations.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You will be pleased to hear that Bulla is in the process of converting the Frozen Yogurt packaging from plastic to paperboard. This change is due to take place by the end this year. It does however take over twelve months to make a change such as this. That is a long time I know, but there are so many things to do. First, we need to source appropriate packaging that is suitable for our equipment. Secondly, w<em>e <\/em>need to trial the packaging on our factory equipment so that it runs smoothly, Finally, we must ensure that our amazing product has the same quality and taste in the new packaging materials.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have been working on this for some time and hope to have the change finalized by the end of the year. So, I do hope you, and your friends, will be patient with us and continue to buy our products to enjoy.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At Bulla we ensure that all our packaging is recyclable. To achieve this, all packaging is assessed using the Planet Ark Packaging Recyclability Evaluation Portal (PREP) tool.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We are moving awa<em>y <\/em>from plastic where possible and introducing paperboard packaging. We have a range of delicious Ice Cream products that use paper packaging, such as our Bulla Splits, Bulla Icy Pops and Bulla Crunch Sticks and the paper packaging is 100% recyclable on all of these. Recently, we launched a yummy range of Ice Cream Tubs &#8220;Murray Street&#8221; all packed in paperboard tubs, which are 100% recyclable and made from renewable material.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you again for your letter and for caring so much about our environment. I hope you are happy with the approach we have taken here at Bulla.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kind regards <br>Allan&nbsp;<br>Allan Hood | Chief Executive Officer<br>February 2021<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Why should you write a letter to a food company?
