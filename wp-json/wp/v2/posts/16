After I sent this my principal said that she supported me going, however since we were a public school we couldn\u2019t promote it at all. I also went to the September 2019 school strike, but then the ACT Labor government said it would support it, so public schools were able to promote it.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dear (principal),<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;On the 15th of March, I won\u2019t be attending school, I will be at the school strike for climate action. The school strike is where a group of students skip school to call on the government to take more effective action against climate change.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;Climate impacts are growing a lot. We\u2019ve had bushfires in winter, and NSW and QLD had been gripped by a crippling drought. Yet our government wants to help billionaire coal companies, like Adani, build massive new coal mines. Coal-fired power plants continue to make climate change worse.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;I think climate change is a really pressing matter, especially now, when we can still make a difference. I honestly think the government is being quite selfish. It\u2019s my generation which will be inheriting this world, and if we don\u2019t do something soon, it will be too late!<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;I hope you will understand that I do care about my education, and I promise to catch up on any work I miss, but I think it\u2019s worth missing one day of school to make this statement. I\u2019m sorry I\u2019ll miss Anti-bullying day, but this school strike is a global event on the 15th of March, and I feel it\u2019s really important to the world.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yours sincerely,<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zari<br><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>This is the letter I sent to my principal explaining why I was going to miss school for the School Strike for Climate Action on 15 March 2019.
