Acknowledge natural guilty feelings. Even if you are innocent, you may will experience feelings of guilt. When someone points a finger at you, some parts of you may feel that you must have done something wrong to deserve such negative treatment. This is totally normal but also irrational.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2. <strong>Find support in others<\/strong><br>Your friends and family know you better than anyone else and will trust in  you. They will share their positive feelings about you with others. If you have a trusted grownup &#8211; like a parent, friend, teacher or employer &#8211; then talk to them about it.

Under Australian laws, defamation includes any form of public speech or publication, including social media. In some states and territories, maliciously defaming someone is a crime. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You could use this:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#1a56bd\" class=\"has-inline-color\"><em>Publishing false material to harm someone&#8217;s reputation is illegal under the Defamation Act 2001.
