I heard that the committee was worried that the kids could break the forks and they would become sharp and splintery, and also the kids might use them as weapons. So I tested a few wooden forks to see how strong they were and if they were sharp and splintery.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The forks I tested were:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Fiesta Green Biodegradable Disposable Birch (packs of 100 only from Nisbets Catering, Fyshwick, $7.04 per 100, GST included)<\/li><li>Kraft Wooden Forks (packs of 12 from CostumeBox, $3.99 per 12, GST included)<\/li><li>Eco Wooden Forks (packs of 25 from CostumeBox, $4.99 per 25, GST included, packs of 100 available for $11.99)<\/li><li>Castaway (packs of 1000, for $60 per 1000, GST included)<\/li><li>Green pack (packs of 1000, for $47.27 per 1000, GST included)<\/li><li>Biome (packs of 25, for $3.00 per 25, GST included)<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>I also tested <strong>plastic<\/strong> forks from the canteen.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the <strong>method<\/strong> that I used to test how easy it was to break the forks:<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, I got three of each type of fork. Next, I labelled the 9 forks. Then, I measured 80 mm on each of them from the start of the handle. After that, I put the fork on the edge of a table at the 80mm mark. Then I got a 1.5 kilogram weight and hung it on a \u2018kraft\u2019 fork number one. Then, I kept adding weights until the fork broke. Next, I recorded how much weight I put on and moved onto \u2018kraft\u2019 fork number two. Then, I repeated the first 6 steps but with \u2018kraft\u2019 fork number three. After that, I repeated all the steps before, but with \u2018eco\u2019 forks. Next, I repeated all the steps before, but with \u2018fiesta\u2019 forks. Finally, I broke each of the three types of forks with my bare hands and wrote down how hard it was to break them.<br><br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/drawings\/u\/0\/d\/sNqkynaiENY4qm71YoWr9pQ\/image?w=277&amp;h=197&amp;rev=1&amp;ac=1&amp;parent=1pmbwTD9SqriS9DtbCfizJiqsJt6jpy0xVd_G2ykvhDU\" alt=\"\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Note: The lid that I used for the weights was 13 grams.
