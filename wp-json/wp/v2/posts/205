It is very long but I have included it in full with some comments on each person&#8217;s arguments.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In summary, though, I said this country was founded on genocide, which is a very strong and emotive word, for which I was rightly challenged. In my responses, I included specific references to the <a href=\"https:\/\/treaties.un.org\/doc\/publication\/unts\/volume%2078\/volume-78-i-1021-english.pdf\">UN Convention for the Prevention and Punishment of Genocide<\/a>. A friend of mine, who joined the conversation to defend me, used specific historical references to the First Fleet. The main person arguing against us based their argument on their own credentials as someone who claims to have a PhD in Australian history and is married to a Wiradjuri woman. They then make a series of assertions about other peoples who suffered violence. But they don&#8217;t provide any specific evidence to support their claims.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So using strong emotive words is more likely to generate a response, but make sure before you do it that you can defend your claims with facts, and that you have credible sources.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As you can see in this conversation, I was trying to be calm and constructive, open to other opinions, and not rude. The other person in this conversation is also being calm, which is good and means that the conversation can be constructive. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/standuptothegrownups.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/IMG-4217.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-220\" width=\"439\" height=\"418\" srcset=\"https:\/\/standuptothegrownups.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/IMG-4217.png 708w, https:\/\/standuptothegrownups.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/IMG-4217-300x286.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 439px) 100vw, 439px\" \/><figcaption>Here you can see I commented under the PM&#8217;s instagram post.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/standuptothegrownups.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/IMG-4218.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-221\" width=\"316\" height=\"319\" srcset=\"https:\/\/standuptothegrownups.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/IMG-4218.png 478w, https:\/\/standuptothegrownups.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/IMG-4218-297x300.png 297w, https:\/\/standuptothegrownups.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/IMG-4218-150x150.png 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 316px) 100vw, 316px\" \/><figcaption>The black censor is someone who was, totally reasonably, asking me to defend what I said.
