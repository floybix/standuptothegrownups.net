You can print it out at your school. When you get signatures, it would be great if you could scan the signed pages and send them to <a href=\"mailto:hi@standuptothegrownups.net\">hi@standuptothegrownups.net <\/a>and I will tell you when we collect enough to present them to the Prime Minister. We have a bit more than 200 signatures now. We are doing printed ones to prove that they are signed by actual kids. It is hard to do that with online petitions. It also shows that they all care enough to actually sign a piece of paper rather than just pressing a button on a device.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To: The Hon Scott Morrison MP, Prime Minister of Australia<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We, the undersigned, are the children of Australia. We are deeply alarmed by the dangers that climate change is posing for our future. This summer, hundreds of children lost their homes and some children lost their parents to catastrophic bushfires all over Australia.

Economists say the most effective and cheapest way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is by putting a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.worldbank.org\/en\/programs\/pricing-carbon\">price on carbon<\/a>.
