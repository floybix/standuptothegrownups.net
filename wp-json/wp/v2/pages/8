When I was 8, I was in Hong Kong during three months of student protests for democracy and I spent a lot of time walking around their camps. Then when I was in Year 6 I lodged a complaint about having too much homework in my school.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In March 2019 I went to the School Strike for Climate Action. I had to do some research before I went the first time because my parents said I wasn\u2019t allowed to go unless I really agreed with what the protesters wanted, and unless I wrote to my school principal explaining why I was going to miss school. <br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the things that made me want to do this was hearing the Prime Minister at the time say that kids should not protest and there should be \u2018more learning and less activism in schools\u2019.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This made me realise that there are lots of issues that are important to kids and that we should have our say. And that we have the right to have our say.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I&#8217;ve set up this website to give kids some tools to have their say effectively. These tools work whether you are trying to change the world, or just trying to change something at school that you think is unfair.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On this website, I have some of the letters that my sister and I have written, and the responses that we got to show you some of the things that have worked (and haven&#8217;t worked) for us.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am also interested in hearing from kids on what issues are important to them. We would like to tell grownups like politicians, who make decisions, what those issues are and what we would like the grownups to do.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>From, Zari <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>P.S remember you can DM us on instagram or comment any of your experiences with activism, and I can even make a page on this site about it. Thanks!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Welcome to Stand Up to the Grownups\" width=\"580\" height=\"326\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/c45tEkQulDU?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, Article 12, states that children should be allowed to express their views on things affecting them, and those views should be taken into account.
